Taboo is the game of unspeakable fun! Can you get your team to say Brain Freeze? What if you can't say Ice Cream, Headache, Eating, Cold or Fast? Not so easy now, is it? When you play Taboo, the obvious clues are strictly taboo! You have to give creative, carefully-worded clues to get your team to guess words fast. But don't mention unmentionables, or you'll get the squeaker and lose the point!
